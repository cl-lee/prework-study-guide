# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a webpage set up to help students from the *Front-End Web Development Bootcamp* with studying Prework. Notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript can be found on the webpage to provide recaps for each topic studied in Prework. 

Over the course of this project, I have learnt to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git to setup the webpage.

There are *four* main sections in the **Prework Study Guide** webpage. In each section, users will find notes from the four topics studied in Prework. These topics are HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

By opening the DevTool console, users will be able to see the running JavaScript. The topics learnt from Prework are listed in the console. Students will also find a recommendation on which topic to study first.
